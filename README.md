# Quantum_simulation_of_wave_packet_inside_a_box
This has the qualitative behavior you might expect from a particle with some momentum in a box: it hits a wall and bounces back. The wave packets still spreads out over time, and near the bounces we start to see interference patterns as the reflected part of the packet interferes with the part that hasnâ€™t reflected yet. These bumpy interference fringes in the probability are a purely quantum mechanical effect, and has no classical analogue for massive particles, which is a measurable way to verify quantum mechanics is an accurate description of reality.
